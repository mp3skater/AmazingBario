> A simple desktop 2D platform game built in **JAVA** using the **javax.swing** library. It's a school project in collaboration with three classmates, where everyone works on different aspects of development. This project aims to be a complete video game but should only be considered as a simple side project, made for fun.

## Features
This project uses JSON files to store the different levels, look at the detailed explenation in the **src/net/mp3skater/main/Level**-class to create your own and play them.

### Added features
- Oldschool platformer with clean graphics
- Efficient and resource-friendly program
- Sound effects and music
- Start & pause menu
- Highscore system that stores the highscores inside of a text file
- Options to regulate and turn off/on the sound effects/music

### In future
- Detailed explenation of how to create your own levels
- Usage of gradle or maven for easier execution
- Maybe level-edit-modus...

## Running the game
For now you should be able to run the game on any device supporting **IntellIJ Idea** with **JAVA** 22+ installed, by running the set run configuration **launch Game** or also by running the class **main/Main**. Later I will try to convert it into a gradle project so it'll become easier.

## Controls

* You can move the player around by using the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys
* Clicking on the screen spawns platforms only the player collides with
* But stay allert, you can't place more than 2 at a time, place them wisely
* Finish each level and aim for the highscore
* If you fall down or get hit by an enemy, you must restart from the beginning of the level
