> A simple desktop 2D platform game built in **JAVA** with **javax.swing** as a school project in collaboration with three classmates to work on different aspects of development. This isis aiming to be a complete video game but should only be considerate as a simple side project, made for fun.

## Features
This project uses JSON files to store the different levels, look at the detailed dokumentation to create your own and play them.

### Added features
- Oldschool platformer with clean graphics
- Efficient and resource-friendly program
- Sound effects and music
- Start & pause menu
- Highscore system that stores the highscores inside of a text file

### In future
- Options to regulate and turn off/on the sound effects/music
- Usage of gradle or maven for easier execution
- Maybe level-edit-modus...

## Running the game
For now you should be able to run the game on any device supporting **IntellIJ Idea** with **JAVA** 22+ installed, by running the set run configuration **launch Game** or also by running the class **main/Main**. Later I will try to convert it into a gradle project so it'll become easier.

## Technologies
Huge thanks to [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow) for his amazing tutorials that helped this project massively!

This project was developed using the following frameworks and tools:

 - [Java Swing](https://www.java-tutorial.org/swing.html)
 - [GSON (google's JSON library)](https://google.github.io/gson/)
 - [IntellIJ idea as IDE and build system](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
 - [Music and Sound Effects (to be done)](pleaseputinthelink)
 - [Logo creator (to be done)](pleaseputinthelink)

## Controls

* You can move the player around by using the `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys
* Clicking on the screen spawns platforms only the player collides with
* But stay allert, you can't place more than 2 at a time, place them wisely
* Finish each level and aim for the highscore
* If you fall down or get hit by an enemy, you must restart from the beginning of the level
